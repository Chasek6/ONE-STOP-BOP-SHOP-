## Usage instructions

Upon loading the app the user can find the signup/login pages by clicking on the person icon in the top right corner of the site in the navigation bar. Once a user is created an account and signed in the user may click on either the vinyl shop button at the top of the home page, or may search by genre lower down to then be taken to the inventory page with all the records available for purchase. Each item has a button which, on click, adds the item to the cart, indicated by a shopping cart icon in the navbar. Once the user has selected everything they wish to purchase, they may then click on the shopping cart and see a checkout button, which would take them to the checkout page where they could then input their payment information and check out their items.
